== Photo recommendations

In this section we'll learn how to use the Label Propagation algorithm to recommend photos.

== Exploring photo tags

== Similar photos

We want to work out which photos are similar to each other based on the labels they've been tagged with.
We can do this using the https://neo4j.com/docs/graph-algorithms/current/algorithms/similarity-jaccard/#algorithms-similarity-jaccard-sample[Jaccard Similarity algorithm^].

Update the following query (copied from the documentation) to:

* Compute similarity between photos based on the labels they have (Hint: you'll need to use the `HAS_LABEL` relationship)
* Find the top 3 most similar photos (Hint: look at the `topK` parameter)
* Store the results in Neo4j (Hint: look at the `write` parameter)

// Change this part of the query
MATCH (p:Person)-[:LIKES]->(cuisine)
WITH {item:id(p), categories: collect(id(cuisine))} as userData

WITH collect(userData) as data

// Fill in the config in this part of the query
CALL algo.similarity.jaccard(data, {

})

YIELD p25, p50, p90, p99, p999, p100,  write
RETURN p25, p50, p90, p99, p999, p100, write

== Answer: Similar Photos

This is what the query should look like:

[source, cypher]
----
MATCH (p:Photo)-[:HAS_LABEL]->(label)
WITH {item:id(p), categories: collect(id(label))} as userData

WITH collect(userData) as data

CALL algo.similarity.jaccard(data, {topK: 3, similarityCutoff: 0.9, write: true})

YIELD p25, p50, p90, p99, p999, p100,  write
RETURN p25, p50, p90, p99, p999, p100, write
----

== Similar photos

Now let's see if we

[source, cypher]
----
MATCH (p1:Photo)-[r:SIMILAR]->(p2:Photo)
RETURN p1.id, r.score, p2.id
LIMIT 10

== Clustering photos

[source, cypher]

CALL algo.labelPropagation("Photo", "SIMILAR", {direction: "BOTH"})
