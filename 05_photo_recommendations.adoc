== Photo recommendations

In this section we'll learn how to use the Label Propagation algorithm to cluster similar photos.

== Exploring photo tags

The photos have been run through Google's Image Labeling service and those labels are connected to photos by the `HAS_LABEL` relationship.
We can run the following query to explore this part of the graph:

[source, cypher]
----
MATCH path = (p:Photo)-[:HAS_LABEL]->(label)
RETURN path
LIMIT 25
----

== Similar photos

We want to work out which photos are similar to each other based on the labels they've been tagged with.
We can do this using the https://neo4j.com/docs/graph-algorithms/current/algorithms/similarity-jaccard/#algorithms-similarity-jaccard-sample[Jaccard Similarity algorithm^].

Update the following query (copied from the documentation) to:

* Compute similarity between photos based on the labels they have (Hint: you'll need to use the `HAS_LABEL` relationship)
* Find the top 3 most similar photos (Hint: look at the `topK` parameter)
* Store the results in Neo4j (Hint: look at the `write` parameter)

[source, cypher]
----
// Change this part of the query
MATCH (p:Person)-[likes:LIKES]->(cuisine)
WITH {item:id(p), categories: collect(id(cuisine))} as userData

WITH collect(userData) as data

// Fill in the config in this part of the query
CALL algo.similarity.jaccard(data, {

})

YIELD p25, p50, p90, p99, p999, p100,  write
RETURN p25, p50, p90, p99, p999, p100, write
----

== Answer: Similar Photos

This is what the query should look like:

[source, cypher]
----
MATCH (p:Photo)-[:HAS_LABEL]->(label)
WITH {item:id(p), categories: collect(id(label))} as userData

WITH collect(userData) as data

CALL algo.similarity.jaccard(data, {topK: 3, similarityCutoff: 0.9, write: true})

YIELD p25, p50, p90, p99, p999, p100,  write
RETURN p25, p50, p90, p99, p999, p100, write
----

== Similar photos

Now let's have a look at the relationships created by the algorithm.
Run the following query:

[source, cypher]
----
MATCH path = (p1:Photo)-[r:SIMILAR]->(p2:Photo)
RETURN path
LIMIT 20
----

== Clustering photos

Now we're going to cluster photos based on the `SIMILAR` relationships.
Update the following query to do this:

[source, cypher]
----
CALL algo.labelPropagation(<nodel-label>, <relationship-type>, {direction: "BOTH"})
----

== Answer: Clustering photos

This is what the query should look like:

[source, cypher]
----
CALL algo.labelPropagation("Photo", "SIMILAR", {direction: "BOTH"})
----

== Explore photo clusters

Let's see how many photos we have in each cluster.
We can run the following query to compute this:

[source, cypher]
----
MATCH (p:Photo)
RETURN p.partition AS partition, count(*) AS count
ORDER BY count DESC
LIMIT 10
----

Now let's go back to our application and use these clusters to make business recommendations.
