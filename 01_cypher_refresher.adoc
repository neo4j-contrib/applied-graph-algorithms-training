== Applied Graph Algorithms Training

Welcome to the Neo4j Graph Algorithms Online Training Course!

In this guide we're going to get familiar with the Yelp dataset.
Let's get started!

== Graph Model

This is the graph model that we'll be working with:

== Cypher Refresher

Cypher is a graph query language that we'll be using in this tutorial.
Let's do some exploratory analysis to get a feel for the data.

== Cypher Refresher: Cities

We'll start by seeing which cities have the most reviews:

[source,cypher]
----
MATCH (c:City)
RETURN c.name, size((c)<-[:IN_CITY]-()) AS numberOfReviews
ORDER BY numberOfReviews DESC
LIMIT 10;
----

Las Vegas, Phoenix, and Toronto have the majority of reviews so we'll use one of those so that we have plenty of data to work with.
We'll use Phoenix because $REASONS.

== Cypher Refresher: Most Reviewed Restaurants

We can find the most reviewed restaurants in Phoenix by executing the following query:

[source,cypher]
----
MATCH (b:Business)-[:IN_CITY]->(:City {name: "Phoenix"})
WHERE (b)-[:IN_CATEGORY]->(:Category {name: "Restaurants"})
RETURN b.id, b.name,
       [(b)-[:IN_CATEGORY]->(category) | category.name] AS categories,
       size((b)<-[:REVIEWS]-()) AS reviews
ORDER BY reviews DESC
LIMIT 10;
----

== Cypher Refresher: Interesting People

And who are some interesting people?

[source,cypher]
----
MATCH (u:User)-[:WROTE]->()-[:REVIEWS]-(business:Business)
WHERE (business:Business)-[:IN_CITY]->(:City {name: "Phoenix"})

WITH u, count(*) AS totalReviews
ORDER BY totalReviews DESC
LIMIT 1000
MATCH (u)-[:WROTE]->()-[:REVIEWS]->()-[:IN_CATEGORY]->(cat)

WITH u, totalReviews, cat, count(*) AS count ORDER BY u, count DESC
WHERE count > 5
RETURN u.id, u.name, totalReviews, collect(cat.name)[..5] AS categories
ORDER BY totalReviews DESC;
----

Let's store some of those interesting users for later.
Run the following query to store them in the `userIds` parameter:

[source,cypher]
----
:param userIds => ["XEHZoTDWjw3w-gcQyYIe4g", "d_TBs6J3twMy9GChqUEXkg", "NwPnvTALYMNZgdiwHHkuAQ"];
----

== Cypher Refresher: Interesting People

What places have these users been reviewing?

[source,cypher]
----
MATCH (u:User)-[:WROTE]->()-[:REVIEWS]->(business:Business)-[:IN_CATEGORY]->(category)
WHERE u.id IN $userIds AND (business)-[:IN_CITY]->(:City {name: "Phoenix"})
WITH u, category, count(*) AS count
ORDER BY u, count DESC
RETURN u, collect({category: category.name, count: count})[..5] AS reviews;
----

Now that we're familiar with the data, let's go back to the Graph Academy Page and learn about Graph Algorithms and the application that we're going to build.
